The box is special because it has the ability to change gravity. \n\nThere are some columns of toy cubes in the box arranged in a line. The `i`-th column contains `a_i` cubes. At first, the gravity in the box is pulling the cubes downwards. When Bob switches the gravity, it begins to pull all the cubes to a certain side of the box, `d`, which can be either `'L'` or `'R'` (left or right). Below is an example of what a box of cubes might look like before and after switching gravity.\n\n```\n+---+                                       +---+\n|   |                                       |   |\n+---+                                       +---+\n+---++---+     +---+              +---++---++---+\n|   ||   |     |   |   -->        |   ||   ||   |\n+---++---+     +---+              +---++---++---+\n+---++---++---++---+         +---++---++---++---+\n|   ||   ||   ||   |         |   ||   ||   ||   |\n+---++---++---++---+         +---++---++---++---+\n```\n\nGiven the initial configuration of the cubes in the box, find out how many cubes are in each of the `n` columns after Bob switches the gravity.\n\n### Examples (input -> output:\n\n```\n* 'R', [3, 2, 1, 2]      ->  [1, 2, 2, 3]\n* 'L', [1, 4, 5, 3, 5 ]  ->  [5, 5, 4, 3, 1]\n```\n","totalAttempts":64743,"totalCompleted":26149,"totalStars":499,"voteScore":2132,"tags":["Puzzles","Arrays"],"contributorsWanted":true,"unresolved":{"issues":0,"suggestions":0}},{"id":"56530b444e831334c0000020","name":"Determine offspring sex based on genes XX and XY chromosomes","slug":"determine-offspring-sex-based-on-genes-xx-and-xy-chromosomes","category":"reference","publishedAt":"2016-07-26T12:48:12.248Z","approvedAt":"2016-07-31T08:53:18.305Z","languages":["javascript","python","java","cpp","csharp","clojure","ruby","php","julia","groovy","dart","coffeescript","crystal","lua","haskell"],"url":"https:\/\/www.codewars.com\/kata\/56530b444e831334c0000020","rank":{"id":-8,"name":"8 kyu","color":"white"},"createdAt":"2015-11-23T12:49:08.804Z","createdBy":{"username":"emporio","url":"https:\/\/www.codewars.com\/users\/emporio"},"approvedBy":{"username":"donaldsebleung","url":"https:\/\/www.codewars.com\/users\/donaldsebleung"},"description":"The male gametes or sperm cells in humans and other mammals are heterogametic and contain one of two types of sex chromosomes.
